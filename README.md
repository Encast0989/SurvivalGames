# SurvivalGames
Minecraft mini-game created using GameEngine. 

MC Version: 1.8.x (might work with later releases of Minecraft as well [1.9.x-1.12.x])

Survival Games was created to show the potential of GameEngine, and as an example to those who wish to use it to create their 
own Minecraft mini-games.

**Maps used in the game will not be included. This is due to (maybe... probably) legal reasons.**
